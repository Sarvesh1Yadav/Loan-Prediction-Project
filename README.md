Introduction

This project aims to predict loan prices using machine learning techniques. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training to provide accurate predictions.

Features

Exploratory Data Analysis
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Feature Selection and Engineering
Model Training and Validation
Prediction and Evaluation

Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
Jupyter Notebook for interactive coding and analysis
Dataset
The dataset contains features like loan amount, interest rate, borrower details, and loan terms. [Include a brief description or link to the dataset source, if public.]

Model Development
The model was developed using supervised learning algorithms. Steps included:

Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical data).
Feature engineering (normalization, scaling).
Model selection and training (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
Performance evaluation using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and RÂ².# Loan-Prediction-Project
